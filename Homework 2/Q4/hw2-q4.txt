4. What is the two's complement representation for
int neg num = -119;
if the computer is representing integers with 4 bytes.
(No programming for this question).

The two's complement would be:

int neg num = -119
two's complement = 

01110111 - 119
10001000 - Flip All 1's and 0's
10001001 - Add One
10001001 - Two's Complement -119
